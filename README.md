<p> What now is called the Emphyerian Confederation was founded in the north. Originally a vassal created by King Tirich the 6th as a buffer zone, Emphyeria was a vast and dismal place. Due to the harsh climate and poor soil, colonists relied on agricultural exports from the kingdom, though corruption often meant much-needed food and supplies disappeared along the way. Raids from the indigenous Kruskan tribes depleted the population, as colonial militias lacked weapons promised to them by the kingdom. This indifference by the Edelchian kingdom, however, had an unintended side effect. Surviving colonists gradually clustered in fortified settlements. Many of these settlements were near the only natural source of water in the land,the Sivyrean river. With the help of friendly Kruskans, native food sources such as okyrangs, a round, orange vegetable that grew in the soil, were cultivated. Aerydium seams were discovered by some colonists. This sturdy mineral, though not valuable, was used to build houses and forts. Trade networks exchanging goods, such as aerydium and okyrangs, between colonies soon followed, facilitated by water trasnport on the Sivyrean river. Settlements developed semi-democratic self-governing councils in absense of royal Edelchian overseers. The Emphyerian Confederation was born. Though life was hard, the colonists survived. That is, until King Xypheris took power. </p>
    
<p> Ever since his parents were killed in the demon invasion a few decades ago, Prince Xypheris was obssessed with finding a way to the demon's dominion for revenge. Many influential nobles objected to the prince's crowning, who they regarded as an incompetent brat chasing an impossible fantasy. The kingdom had barely managed to fend off the otherworldly invaders, even with the help of magically-enhanced heroes. To start another war with them was suicidal. Records state that the heroes sealed the demon's portal, though no one knew how long that would last. These dissenters were quickly silenced, as the now king Xypheris began amassing a large army to invade the demon's dominion. Anti-demon propoganda was spread throughout the kingdom in an attempt to win public support. Finally, the day came to start his assault. </p>
    
The Emphyerian Confederation, meanwhile, strenthened, as settlements became towns and towns became cities. It was a miracle for civilization to develop in the barren wastelands of the north. Unfortunately, when Emphyerian leaders refused Xypheris' calls for soldiers, Eldechian military forces started consolidating at the Emphyerian borders. To Xypheris, refusal was tantamount to treason. He planned to make an example of Emphyeria before launching his crusade. Unbeknownst to the human nations, major events were unfolding in the demon's dominion. A poewrful demon queen has arisen among her people, ending the endless fighting of the demon clans after their failed invasion. Gathering her forces, she patiently waited for the human nations to weaken. Finally, the human menace will be vanquished, with the heroes no longer alive to save them. She will bring salvation for her demon brethren as the plentiful resources of the human world will be theirs. Her name is Queen Sakrieon.
